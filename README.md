# Gate-Pass-Management-System

🚪 Gate Pass Management System (MERN Stack)
The Gate Pass Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and digitize the process of issuing, managing, and tracking gate passes in an institutional or organizational setting. Built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this system replaces manual gate pass procedures with an efficient and secure digital workflow.

📌 Key Features
👤 User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login for students, faculty, and gatekeepers with role-based access.

📝 Pass Request & Approval Flow: Students can request passes, which can be approved or rejected by admins/staff.

🔍 Real-Time Tracking: Gatekeepers can view and validate approved passes as students exit or enter.

📋 Pass History Records: Maintains a complete log of all gate pass requests and actions.

📨 Email Alerts (Optional): Notifies users on approval or rejection (can be enhanced using nodemailer).

📊 Admin Dashboard: Overview of all requests, user activity, and system stats.
